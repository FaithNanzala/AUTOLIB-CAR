Description

Autolib is operated by the Bollor√© Group enterprise, which won the contract to develop the service and to supply Paris with electric cars and stations. The program started in 2011 with an initial fleet of 250 eco-friendly electric Blue Cars. The program today has more than 3,000 cars operating on the streets of Paris and within the whole region. There are around 860 Autolib stations where users can subscribe, pick up or drop off the cars. As well, there are 4,400 parking spaces and charging points reserved exclusively for Blue cars.

The aim of our research is to come up with relevant data on blue cars usage and advice the management on resource allocation based on our findings.

Objective:

Our main objective is to find out if there is a difference between the number of blue cars taken on weekdays from postal codes 75011 and 75015.
